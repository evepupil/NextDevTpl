      },
      {
        "question": "What tech stack does it use?",
        "answer": "Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/UI, Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, Better Auth for authentication, Creem for payments, Inngest for async processing, next-intl for i18n, and Biome for linting and formatting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the credits system designed?",
        "answer": "The credits system uses double-entry bookkeeping with FIFO batch expiration. Every credit movement creates a transaction with debit and credit accounts. Credits can be granted via subscriptions, purchases, or admin actions, and consumed by any feature you build."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the subscription plans?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The subscription plan configuration is centralized in a single config file. You can adjust plan names, pricing, credit allocations, feature limits, and billing cycles to match your product's needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it support background processing?",
        "answer": "Yes. Inngest handles all background jobs, solving the serverless timeout problem. Tasks run asynchronously with status polling and progress tracking built in. You can easily add your own Inngest functions for any long-running work."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it ready for production?",
        "answer": "Yes. The template includes rate limiting, error monitoring (Sentry), structured logging (Pino + Axiom), secure file storage (Cloudflare R2), and graceful degradation for optional services. It's designed to run on a VPS or any Node.js hosting platform."
