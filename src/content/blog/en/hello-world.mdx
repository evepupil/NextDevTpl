# Hello World

Welcome to the NextDevTpl blog! We're excited to share our journey of building the ultimate Next.js starter kit.

## What is NextDevTpl?

NextDevTpl is a modern, production-ready SaaS boilerplate built with:

- **Next.js 15** - The React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Better Auth** - Modern authentication
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database access

## Why We Built This

Building a SaaS application from scratch is time-consuming. You need to set up authentication, database connections, styling, and countless other features before you can even start working on your actual product.

NextDevTpl solves this by providing a solid foundation that includes:

1. **Authentication** - Email/password, OAuth providers
2. **Database** - PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
3. **UI Components** - Beautiful, accessible components
4. **Internationalization** - Multi-language support
5. **SEO** - Optimized for search engines

## Getting Started

To get started with NextDevTpl, simply clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in our documentation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextdevtpl/nextdevtpl.git
cd nextdevtpl
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
